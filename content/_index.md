## About Me

I am Fifth Year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/) at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) working under the supervision of [Prof. Bhaswar B. Bhattacharya](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~bhaswar/). Before joining here, I recieved my Bachelor and Master degrees in Statistics at the [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/).

## Research Interest

The main themes of my research include inference in network models, kernel methods for non-parametric testing, and graphical models. In addition to this, I am also interested in various fields, including but not limited to random matrix theory and differential privacy. My current publications and preprints can be found [here.](https://anirbanc96.github.io/main/research/).
