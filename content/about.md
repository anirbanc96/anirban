  I'm Anirban, Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at [The Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/), [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) advised by [Prof. Bhaswar B. Bhattacharya](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~bhaswar/index.html). Before joining here, I earned both my Bachelor of Statistics and Master of Statistics at the [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/).
  
  Equipped with a strong mathematical foundation I'm interested to explore the depths of statistical theory and its real-world applications. My current research is primarily focused on exploring and understanding connections between non-parametric statistical inference, network models and nearest-neighbor methods. Beyond this, I'm intrigued by a variety of domains, including but not limited to differential privacy, distribution-free inference, and random-matrix theory. My current publications and preprints can be found [here.](https://anirbanc96.github.io/main/research/)

In my free time I enjoy traveling, reading thrillers and watching soccer. 

I warmly welcome the opportunity to connect with like-minded professionals, researchers, and mentors. Please feel free to reach out through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anirban-chatterjee-99742611b/) or via email at <span style="color: navy;">anirbanc@wharton.upenn.edu</span>.
