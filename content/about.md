  I'm Anirban, a Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at [The Wharton School](https://www.wharton.upenn.edu/), [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/) advised by [Prof. Bhaswar B. Bhattacharya](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~bhaswar/index.html). Before joining here, I earned both my Bachelor of Statistics and Master of Statistics at the[Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/). These formative years equipped me with a strong mathematical foundation to explore the depths of statistical theory and its real-world applications. 
  
  My research is primarily focused on exploring and understanding connections between non-parametric statistical inference, network models and nearest-neighbor methods. Furthermore, my interests span across different domains, including but not limited to differential privacy, distribution-free inference, and random-matrix theory. My current publications and preprints can be found [here.](https://anirbanc96.github.io/anirban/research/)
